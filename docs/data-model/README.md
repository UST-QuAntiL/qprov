# Quantum Provenance Data Model

Bellow you can find the provenance data model that underlies the QProv system.
Thereby, the base classes from the [PROV standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/) are represented in green, and all other classes represent domain specific entities, activities, and agents, that are used to collect the characteristics of quantum computations.
